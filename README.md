# KerSpecGen
The goal of this project is to automate the generation of kernel specifications. Based on the SeL4 secure kernel project, we have constructed a knowledge graph of specification properties using a refinement approach. 
Additionally, this project has created the KerSpecProperty dataset for specification properties and the KerSpecCode dataset for specification properties and code. KerSpecProperty can serve as a benchmark for validating specification properties, while KerSpecCode is used for fine-tuning/training models and validating model performance.
